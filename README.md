who-you
=======

A testbed project for a convenient-yet-light(ish)-weight framework for a web/mobile-web app

Specifically, using:

* jquery (complete, a subset or some ligher lib or with a similar interface) for DOM querying, ajax
* Mustache.js (or a similar template engine) for DOM creation and cheap 'views'
* AMD for module loading and code organization 
* data store concepts (and possibly implementations) from Dojo

Status
------

Initial scribblings. The people list will eventually be editable, so we'll need a read-write store.
Also I /think/ we'll have a router and controllers for the different functions of the app
And some pushState action to make these functions/states addressable
